# Utilities

There's some utilities that you can use for your `variables` and `computedVariables` :

- camelCase (reactComponent)
- snakeCase (react_component)
- kebabCase (react-component)
- upperCase (REACT COMPONENT)
- lowerCase (react component)
- startCase (React Component)
- capitalize (React component)
- upperFirst (React component)
- lowerFirst (react component)
- pascalCase (ReactComponent)
- constantCase (REACT_COMPONENT)
- pluralCase (react components)
- singularCase (react component)

Utilities can be used together with dot separation thanks to [GearIntellix](https://github.com/gearintellix) for example (`ComponentName.pluralCase.pascalCase` and so on)
