# Using Templates

You can use your created templates in two ways:

**Using Command Palette:**

- Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (or `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux) to open the command palette.
- Search for `Templater: Use Template` and select it.
- Follow the prompts to:
  - Select the template you want to use.
  - Input any variables required by the template.
- With this way, the template will be created on `targetDirectory` from the template config.

If you want to use your template on the other place instead on `targetDirectory` that defined on config, you can use **Using File Explorer Context Menu:**

- Right-click in the File Explorer.
- Select `Use Template`.
- Follow the prompts as described above.
- With this way, instead of on `targetDirectory`, it'll create the template on selected directory
